## Question
### 1464. [Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-two-elements-in-an-array/)
Given the array of integers nums, you will choose two different indices i and j of that array. Return the maximum
value of (nums[i]-1)*(nums[j]-1).

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,4,5,2]
Output: 12 
Explanation: If you choose the indices i=1 and j=2 (indexed from 0), you will get the maximum value, that is, (nums[1]-1)*(nums[2]-1) = (4-1)*(5-1) = 3*4 = 12.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,5,4,5]
Output: 16
Explanation: Choosing the indices i=1 and j=3 (indexed from 0), you will get the maximum value of (5-1)*(5-1) = 16.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,7]
Output: 12


Constraints:=
2 <= nums.length <= 500
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^3

## Solutions


class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return (nums[-1] - 1) * (nums[-2] - 1)
