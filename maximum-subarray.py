## Question : Easy
### 53. [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum
and return its sum.

Example:
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

Follow up:
If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is
more subtle.
