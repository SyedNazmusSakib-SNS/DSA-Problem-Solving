## Question

### 13. [Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I, V, X, L, C, D and M` .

| | |
|**Symbol**|**Value**|
|:--:|:--:|
|I|1|
|V|5|
|X|10|
|L|50|
|C|100|
|D|500|
|M|1000|


For example, `two` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `Twelve` is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `twenty seven` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for `four` is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

`I` can be placed before `V (5)` and `X (10)` to make `4` and `9`. 
`X` can be placed before `L (50)` and `C (100)` to make `40` and `90`. 
`C` can be placed before `D (500)` and `M (1000)` to make `400` and `900`.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from `1 to 3999`.

Example 1:

```
Input: "III"
Output: 3
```

Example 2:

```
Input: "IV"
Output: 4
```

Example 3:

```
Input: "IX"
Output: 9
```

Example 4:

```
Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
```

Example 5:

```
Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```
